# Denon AVR Sync

This is just a simple utility to control a Denon AVR from a computer on the same network. The goal is not full functionality, but instead just convenience for the basic functions that are needed to implement a home media solution.

Key functions:

- Audio level control
- Power/Standby control
- Source selection
